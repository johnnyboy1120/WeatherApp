✅ Add a logo
- Add pictures
- Create a bar for weather in the next few days???
✅ Implement user login and favorite weather feature (top 3 cities, info saved in a CSV file)
✅ Automatically get the user's city using another API (tested and works)
✅ Use more colors and make it look less like a survey





Should I make the design simpler (maybe add a bit more but not too much changes) 
but add info like next few days, log in option showing top 3 favorite cities, 
and also add the automatic city getting api?


- Location
    submit - city
    mylocation - api
    

- Home page -> not logged in
- Login in button in this homepage

- When in Login.html, it asks for login, if no account, 
  create new account is on the bottom (register.html)
- When clicked create new account, go to register.html html

- After signing up, let the user login again. Redirect to login page.
- After login in, set log in
